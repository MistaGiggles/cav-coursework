 Given two rotation matrices, the problem is to find a way of
  determining intermediate positions specified by a parametric
  variable t, where t ranges from 0.0 to 1.0

  This can be achieved by converting the two matrices into either
  Euler angles or Spherical rotation angles (via quaternions) and
  a translation vector.
  In either case, each matrix is converted into a pair of 3D vectors.

  Interpolation between these two vectors can then be performed
  through the use of the standard linear interpolation equation:

      Vr = Va + t .(Vb - Va )

  where Vr is the resulting vector
        Va is the start position vector
        Vb is the final position vector

  This equation may be applied to both translation and rotation
  vectors.

  Once determined, the resulting translation and rotation are then
  converted back into the desired intermediate matrix.
