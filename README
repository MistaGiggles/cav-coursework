CAV Coursework Assignment 1

Controls:
F1: View Rigged Model
F2: View Skeleton (Slow)

Compilation:
the comp.sh script is used to compile the program.

Running
./view <model> <skeleton> <weights>
example:
./view arma2.obj skeleton2.out attachment2.out

OR

run.sh can be used to run the progam.

Animation file anim_turn is loaded automatically and executed.


Issues:

Animation moves the characters right hand, and for some reason the weights of some vertices in the hip are tied to the righ hand. This is a problem within the supplied weights file. This produces the weird hip bulge during the animation.


Other animations can be generated, the file wave_raw contains frame information for animation and the animGen.py python script produces a format for the program to interpret.

wave_raw format:
by_time boneid rotX rotY rotZ boneid rotX rotY rotZ boneid rotX rotY rotZ boneid rotX rotY rotZ
