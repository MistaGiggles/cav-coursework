Computer Animation and Visualisation coursework.

Given a demo program that can load and display a model, the coursework was to extend the demo to allow for skeletal animation.
arma2.obj         is the model file
skeleton2.out     is the skeleton file, listing the bone structure and positions of joints
attachment2.out   is the weights file, it details the influence each bone has over a specific vertice in the model

Use ./comp.sh to compile (with optimisations) and ./run.sh to run the program with the model, skeleton and weights

Interactive control is to be added.

Keyframe animation is planned.
